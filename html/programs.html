                                    <span>Simulated Impaired Driving Experience (SIDNE): </span>Is the newest tool in the fight against drunk driving. It's a battery-powered, remote-controlled vehicle that resembles a go-cart and simulates the experience of driving under the influence of drugs and alcohol. SIDNE is now being introduced to enable high school students, college students, and parents to experience firsthand the often unimagined impact of driving while under the influence. SIDNE is a prevention initiative utilized and demonstrated in a collaborative effort by NCADD Putnam, Communities That Care Coalition and the Putnam County Youth Bureau, to deliver engaging and hands-on lessons about the misuse and abuse of alcohol and other drugs and the dangers of distracted driving. SIDNE activities include fatal vision goggles, simulated field sobriety test, activities to exhibit weight to alcohol consumption comparison, and activities to exhibit the ease of getting distracted while driving. For more questions on SIDNE please contact Elaine Santos at <a href='mailto:putnamdfcgrantee@gmail.com'>putnamdfcgrantee@gmail.com</a>
