#Putnam NCADD Website Archive
This is an archive of a project I was maintaining when I got started in web development.

I only worked with the HTML and CSS during the time I was maintaining it.


To see what this site would have looked like, please refer to the projects section of my personal website, found [here](http://projects.saltor.nyc/Putnam%20NCADD/).


##Update Log
[Oct 16, 2016] After reading some more on accessibility I thought I'd check out this project again and see what I could do to improve it since it's essentially just HTML and CSS. My goal is to not change the technologies used in it's presentation, but rather change/add the technologies used in it's compilation.
